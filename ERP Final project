Program Analysis Report
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System
1. Executive Summary
This report presents a detailed analysis of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system implemented in Java. The system demonstrates fundamental ERP functionalities including inventory management, user management, order processing, and predictive analytics.
2. System Architecture
2.1 Component Overview
The system consists of four main components:

Main Application (App.java)

Entry point of the application
Handles user interaction and menu navigation


ERP Core System (ERPSystem.java)

Manages inventory operations
Handles user management
Implements alert system


Leaderboard System (Leaderboard.java)

Tracks user performance
Manages scoring system


Prediction Engine (PredictionEngine.java)

Generates future order predictions
Implements basic forecasting functionality

3. Functional Analysis
3.1 Core Features

Inventory Management

Add new items
View current inventory
Low inventory alerts


User Management

User registration
User listing
Basic user tracking


Order Processing

Score-based order tracking
User performance monitoring


Performance Tracking

Leaderboard system
Score accumulation
Sorted display of rankings


Predictive Analytics

Basic order prediction
Random-based forecasting



3.2 Technical Implementation Details
Data Structures Used:

ArrayList<String> for inventory and user lists
HashMap<String, Integer> for user scores
Scanner for user input handling

Key Methods:
javaCopy// ERPSystem
addInventory(String item)
manageInventory()
checkInventory()
triggerAlert(String message)

// Leaderboard
addUserScore(String user, int score)
displayLeaderboard()

// PredictionEngine
predictFutureOrders()
4. Performance Analysis
4.1 Time Complexity

Inventory Operations: O(1) for additions
User Management: O(1) for additions
Leaderboard Display: O(n log n) due to sorting
Prediction Generation: O(1)

4.2 Space Complexity

Inventory Storage: O(n) where n is number of items
User Storage: O(m) where m is number of users
Leaderboard Storage: O(k) where k is number of scored users

5. Code Quality Assessment
5.1 Strengths

Modularity

Clear separation of concerns
Independent component functionality
Loose coupling between classes


Maintainability

Well-organized class structure
Consistent coding style
Clear method naming


Extensibility

Easy to add new features
Modular design allows for component updates
Clear interface boundaries



5.2 Areas for Improvement

Code Robustness

Limited error handling
Missing input validation
No exception management


Data Management

No persistent storage
Limited data validation
Basic data structures only


Security

No authentication mechanism
Missing access control
No data encryption



6. Recommendations
6.1 Immediate Improvements

Error Handling
javaCopytry {
    // existing code
} catch (InputMismatchException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
    scanner.nextLine(); // clear scanner buffer
}

Data Validation
javaCopypublic void addInventory(String item) {
    if (item == null || item.trim().isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Item cannot be null or empty");
    }
    // existing code
}


6.2 Long-term Enhancements

Database Integration

Implement persistent storage
Add transaction management
Enable data backup/recovery


Security Framework

Add user authentication
Implement role-based access control
Add data encryption


Enhanced Features

Advanced prediction algorithms
Reporting capabilities
Audit logging



7. Risk Assessment
7.1 Technical Risks

Data loss due to in-memory storage
Security vulnerabilities
Limited scalability

7.2 Operational Risks

No user session management
Limited backup capabilities
Basic error handling

8. Conclusion
The ERP system provides a solid foundation for basic enterprise resource planning functionality. While the current implementation is suitable for small-scale operations, implementing the suggested improvements would significantly enhance its reliability, security, and scalability for production use.
9. Future Development Roadmap
Phase 1 (Short-term)

Implement basic error handling
Add input validation
Implement file-based storage

Phase 2 (Mid-term)

Database integration
User authentication
Basic reporting features

Phase 3 (Long-term)

Advanced analytics
API development
Mobile interface
